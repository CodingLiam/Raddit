Built a Reddit clone with Ruby on Rails.

Gives users the ability to sign in/sign out/sign up and to submit links.

I am adding functionality to upvote and downvote links too and also a comments section.

I am following along on a tutorial by Mackenzie here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7-1HCWbu7iU

Enjoy!
